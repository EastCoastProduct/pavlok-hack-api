# express-api-skeleton
The purpose of this repository is for you to be able to easily start working on your API using express. This is just skeleton that takes some assumptions on how project should be structured. It also provides some basic tests to get you started on properly testing your code and hopefully using TDD.

There is also basic gulpfile with a linter and tasks to run tests and have coverage for them. As noted its just a skeleton with some useful tools and project structure can be easily adjusted to your needs.
